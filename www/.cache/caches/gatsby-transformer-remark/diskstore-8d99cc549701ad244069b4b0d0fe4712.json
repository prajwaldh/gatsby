There isn‚Äôt some magic percentage threshold that, when crossed, indicates that a static site is now an application. Nor is the inverse true, that an ‚Äúapp‚Äù is somehow static because some percentage of its content never or rarely changes.</p>\n<p>From this perspective, it‚Äôs fair to consider dynamic content as the key determinant between static sites and apps. The more dynamic content an application has, the more app-like that application feels. From this basis, Gatsby is an excellent choice because it enables dynamic functionality just as easily as it enables static site generation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-gatsby-enable-app-functionality\"><a href=\"#how-does-gatsby-enable-app-functionality\" aria-label=\"how does gatsby enable app functionality permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How does Gatsby enable app functionality?</h2>\n<p>Gatsby is great for static sites and for truly maximizing performance, while also maintaining a great developer experience and enabling fast feature development with tools developers actually <em>want</em> to use. React, GraphQL, headless CMSes, and the list goes on and on. We enable these, and more, in an easy-to-use package that gets blazing-fast performance, by <em>default</em>. It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôve heard us talk about these things before üòÖ We‚Äôve honed in on this message and initially focused on this core functionality of building static sites. However, that‚Äôs only one side of the coin. Gatsby‚Äôs flexibility and one of its <strong>core</strong> ideas enable building apps on top of this solid static base.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hydration\"><a href=\"#hydration\" aria-label=\"hydration permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Hydration</h3>\n<p>One of the central ideas of Gatsby is that we statically generate our HTML content‚Äîusing React DOM server-side APIs. A less-often illustrated feature is that this static HTML content can then be <em>enhanced</em> with client-side JavaScript via React hydration. The general approach is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build and render static HTML, creating content and pages with data injected at build time</li>\n<li>Invoke <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate\">ReactDOM.hydrate method</a> to pick up just where we left our static HTML</li>\n<li>Transfer rendering to the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html\">React reconciler</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It‚Äôs this last phase that bridges the gap between static sites and full-fledged applications. In this phase you can make data calls, authenticate users, and perform all the app-like functionality you desire.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs really that easy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-cases\"><a href=\"#use-cases\" aria-label=\"use cases permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Use cases</h2>\n<p>Gatsby enables these hooks to deliver app-like functionality, just as it does for static site generation. However, it‚Äôs not as clear when it makes sense to reach for something purely server rendered (Next.js, Nuxt, etc.) or a hybrid approach, like we offer in Gatsby. In the webinar, I‚Äôll go over a number of examples of various types of web apps, including e-commerce apps, apps which utilize authentication, and apps that connect to a remote data source (e.g. a GraphQL API), among others! You‚Äôll leave having a clear mental model of the types of apps that <strong>you</strong> can build with Gatsby.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrap-up\"><a href=\"#wrap-up\" aria-label=\"wrap up permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Wrap Up</h2>\n<p>If these briefly described topics and use cases sound interesting to you then please consider <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/build-web-apps-webinar\">signing up for the Webinar</a>.
