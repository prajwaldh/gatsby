Go ahead and blink—I dare you! It’s a framework that not only helps people create super fast websites, but it’s also a great equalizer of the web. Think about it: if you’re in an area that has 3G internet, many sites can take about 15 seconds to load, if they even load at all. Thanks to Gatsby’s performance-first architecture, the same site can be on-screen in less than 3 seconds. So Gatsby can really bring the information to everyone.</p>\n<p>Gatsby is also open source and currently has 1000+ contributors. For all the time, energy, and help they’ve given, we wanted to find a way to thank them properly.</p>\n<p>But how could we do this? Our contributors live all around the world—on 6 continents!</p>\n<p>After a lot of discussion, we settled on giving people free swag! It was a great way to show our appreciation and give away something useful as well.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we needed to find a way to get swag into the hands of contributors quickly and reliably, with no human bottlenecks. The rest of this article is a breakdown of how we made that happen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"identify-our-goal\"><a href=\"#identify-our-goal\" aria-label=\"identify our goal permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Identify our Goal</h2>\n<p>Just because we knew that we wanted to send people swag didn’t mean that our goal was complete. We still had to narrow it down and decide what <em>type</em> of swag to have.</p>\n<p>That meant we had to do a little bit of research. We asked people what type of swag they liked to receive and also what type of swag they <em>wanted</em> to see, even if they hadn’t found anyone who was doing it yet.</p>\n<p>Overall, a lot of people said they liked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>T-shirts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Socks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Donations to charities</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also saw that people were excited about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Nail wraps</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scrunchies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stickers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So...

We decided on shirts because we already had the design for those. We also got socks for people (like me) who always find off the rack shirts impossible to wear and look good. And of course we got some stickers so that we could wallpaper our laptops with Gatsby.</p>\n<p>We also wanted the process of buying swag to be a fun and personable experience from beginning to end. People so willingly show their appreciation for Gatsby, and we wanted to be able to show our excitement and appreciation, too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/money-shower-b5c0aa27d8613e5880cac6a51360d507.gif\" alt=\"Tina Fey in a money shower\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"figuring-out-our-limitations-and-our-strengths\"><a href=\"#figuring-out-our-limitations-and-our-strengths\" aria-label=\"figuring out our limitations and our strengths permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Figuring Out Our Limitations and Our Strengths</h2>\n<p>Now that we’d decided on <em>what</em> we were going to have, we came up against the inevitable, ever burning question, “How the hell can we make this work?”</p>\n<p><img src=\"/giphy-1-b1681d213022a1f40c1e6d0cfe81636d.gif\" alt=\"Rosie Perez &#x22;What?&#x22;\"></p>\n<p>And that question could only be answered by looking at what we had—and what we didn’t have.

It needed to be scalable.</p>\n<p><strong>Deciding if something will scale</strong></p>\n<p>This is where we get deeper into systems and scalability. There are a set of questions that I always ask myself to decide if something is actually scalable.</p>\n<p><em>How modular is the process?</em></p>\n<p>It should be easy to identify and move pieces of the process around. If adding or removing pieces of the process makes it break down, then it’s not modular, and won’t scale appropriately.</p>\n<p><em>How well documented is the process?</em></p>\n<p>Could someone just coming in to the process find the information they needed to immediately start working on it? If the answer to that is no, then the process isn’t well documented, and won’t scale since it’s prohibitively difficult to train every single newcomer the same every time. That means that documented resources need to be available for people to find and execute.</p>\n<p><em>How dependent on the individual is the process?</em></p>\n<p>This is a bit like the “vacation principle”. If the main person who created or implemented the process were to go on vacation for a week would it be possible to move the project forward? If the answer to that is no, then we need to identify the reason why. The gaps we see there are the ones that need to be fixed before the process is actually scalable.</p>\n<p><em>When we add more people, does the process stay efficient or come to a halt?</em></p>\n<p>As you add and onboard people to the process you’re creating, you need to check in on the health of the process. What’s working and not working? If the process that’s been created gets completed more slowly, or there are constant blockers, then it’s not going to be efficient as it scales.</p>\n<p><strong>Some things just don’t scale</strong></p>\n<p>While we were able to scale the process for the swag store largely through automation and decentralization, some things just don’t scale.</p>\n<p>Any process that requires high effort manual and/or daily interaction in order to keep it running—like reaching out to every customer for a short interview or building something entirely in-house just can’t scale up very well.</p>\n<p>But starting from a non-scalable solution is a great way to get started. While you’re able to, talk to every customer. But as the company grows, there have to be ways of setting up processes that take into account the fact that there will be more customers that you can directly interact with, and there will be more people involved in moving the business forward.</p>\n<p>More people leads to more complexity, and processes exist to improve communication, efficiency, and transparency for people in the company and the customers who use the product. If we’re creating a process that slows people down, then it’s simply got to go. All processes should be flexible enough to change and grow with the people they’re intended to help.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-process-had-to-be-easily-repeatable\"><a href=\"#the-process-had-to-be-easily-repeatable\" aria-label=\"the process had to be easily repeatable permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The process had to be easily repeatable</h3>\n<p>We made things more repeatable by creating internal documentation, and sharing it with the rest of the team.
