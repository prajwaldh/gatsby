After the initial page load, Gatsby ensures that the browser begins fetching each additional page that is linked to ahead of time. When the user clicks a link, the browser doesn’t need to make an additional round-trip request to the server to get the next page. The experience of navigating around the site is noticeably faster than traditional page loads, and Gatsby provides a plugin to ensure that Google Analytics actions are still triggered for each routing event.","position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":36,"offset":5315},"end":{"line":34,"column":730,"offset":6009}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":1,"offset":5280},"end":{"line":34,"column":730,"offset":6009}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"wordpress-integration-with-triggered-builds"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#wordpress-integration-with-triggered-builds","aria-label":"wordpress integration with triggered builds permalink","class":"anchor"},"children":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]},{"type":"text","value":"WordPress Integration with Triggered Builds","position":{"start":{"line":36,"column":4,"offset":6014},"end":{"line":36,"column":47,"offset":6057}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":36,"column":1,"offset":6011},"end":{"line":36,"column":47,"offset":6057}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To connect with the content, we used Gatsby’s supported WordPress REST API plugin.
