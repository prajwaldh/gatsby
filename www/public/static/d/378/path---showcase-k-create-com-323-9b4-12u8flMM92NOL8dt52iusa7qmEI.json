I’m Kris. I’m an interactive designer / developer. I grew up in Umeå, in northern Sweden, but I now live in Brooklyn, NY. I am currently enjoying a hybrid Art Director + Lead Product Engineer role at a small startup called Nomad Health. Before that, I was a Product (Engineering) Manager at Tumblr. Before that, I worked at agencies. Before that, I was a baby. I like to design things, and then I like to build those things. I occasionally take on freelance projects. Feel free to get in touch if you have an interesting project that you want to collaborate on. Or if you just want to say hello, that’s cool too.","childScreenshot":{"screenshotFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/ee36f/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/91efe/placeholder.png 175w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/d8219/placeholder.png 350w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/ee36f/placeholder.png 700w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/bafb9/placeholder.png 1050w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/1c05c/placeholder.png 1400w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/0c181/placeholder.png 2048w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/4c8c4/placeholder.jpg"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/showcase/k-create.com"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/showcase/k-create.com"}}
