People consider UX to be sort of expensive, in the sense that it takes time, resources, maybe hiring someone. It can also be sort of intimidating to think of how to hire someone with UX expertise, or to try to develop the expertise yourself.

If you have a friend at another company that has people that would use your product, ask your friend for referrals and offer them and their referrals something nice like an Amazon gift card. If you go watch a group of people while they work, bring lunch as a gift.
