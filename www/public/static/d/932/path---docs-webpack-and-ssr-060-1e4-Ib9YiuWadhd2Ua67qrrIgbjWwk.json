This is empty when you initialize a new project and can be safely deleted. Gatsby creates and fills it over the course of a build.</p>\n<p>At the start of the build, Gatsby <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/bootstrap/index.js#L191\">copies all files</a> in <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby/cache-dir\">gatsby/cache-dir</a> into your <code class=\"language-text\">.cache</code> directory. This includes things like <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/cache-dir/static-entry.js\">static-entry.js</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/cache-dir/production-app.js\">production-app.js</a> that you’ll read about in the next sections. Essentially, all files that are needed by Gatsby to run in the browser, or to generate HTML, are included in <code class=\"language-text\">cache-dir</code>.</p>\n<p>Since Webpack doesn’t know about Redux, we also need to create files that contain all the page data that was built up during bootstrap. And these all need to be placed in <code class=\"language-text\">.cache</code> as well. This is what the previous <a href=\"/docs/write-pages/\">Write Out Pages</a> section dealt with.</p>","excerpt":"Bootstrap is finished! And we’ve  written the resulting pages  to disk.
