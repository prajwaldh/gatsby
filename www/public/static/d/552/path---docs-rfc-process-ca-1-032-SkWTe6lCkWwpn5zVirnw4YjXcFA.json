Some examples that would benefit from\nan RFC are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new feature that creates new API surface area, and would\nrequire a feature flag if introduced.</li>\n<li>The removal of features that already shipped as part of the release\nchannel.</li>\n<li>The introduction of new idiomatic usage or conventions, even if they\ndo not include code changes to Gatsby itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The RFC process is a great opportunity to get more eyeballs on your proposal\nbefore it becomes a part of a released version of Gatsby. Quite often, even\nproposals that seem “obvious” can be significantly improved once a wider group\nof interested people have a chance to weigh in.</p>\n<p>The RFC process can also be helpful to encourage discussions about a proposed\nfeature as it is being designed, and incorporate important constraints into the\ndesign while it’s easier to change, before the design has been fully\nimplemented.</p>\n<p>Some changes do not require an RFC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rephrasing, reorganizing or refactoring addition or removal of warnings</li>\n<li>Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality\ncriteria (speedup, better browser support)</li>\n<li>Additions only likely to be <em>noticed by</em> other implementors-of-Gatsby,\ninvisible to users-of-Gatsby.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-the-process-is\"><a href=\"#what-the-process-is\" aria-label=\"what the process is permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What the process is</h2>\n<p>In short, to get a major feature added to Gatsby, one usually first gets the\nRFC merged into the RFC repo as a markdown file. At that point the RFC is\n‘active’ and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion into\nGatsby.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fork the RFC repo <a href=\"http://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs\">http://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs</a> Copy <code class=\"language-text\">0000-template.md</code> to</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">text/0000-my-feature.md</code> (where\n‘my-feature’ is descriptive. Don’t assign an RFC number yet).</li>\n<li>Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: <strong>RFCs that do not\npresent convincing motivation, demonstrate understanding of the impact of the\ndesign, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be\npoorly-received</strong>.</li>\n<li>Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design\nfeedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to revise\nit in response.</li>\n<li>Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support\nare much more likely to make progress than those that don’t receive any\ncomments.</li>\n<li>Eventually, the team will decide whether the RFC is a candidate\nfor inclusion in Gatsby.</li>\n<li>RFCs that are candidates for inclusion in Gatsby will enter a “final comment\nperiod” lasting 3 calendar days. The beginning of this period will be signaled\nwith a comment and tag on the RFCs pull request.</li>\n<li>An RFC can be modified based upon feedback from the team and community.\nSignificant modifications may trigger a new final comment period.</li>\n<li>An RFC may be rejected by the team after public discussion has settled\nand comments have been made summarizing the rationale for rejection. A member\nof the team should then close the RFCs associated pull request.</li>\n<li>An RFC may be accepted at the close of its final comment period. A team\nmember will merge the RFCs associated pull request, at which point the RFC will\nbecome ‘active’.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-rfc-life-cycle\"><a href=\"#the-rfc-life-cycle\" aria-label=\"the rfc life cycle permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The RFC life-cycle</h2>\n<p>Once an RFC becomes active, then authors may implement it and submit the\nfeature as a pull request to the Gatsby repo. Becoming ‘active’ is not a rubber\nstamp, and in particular still does not mean the feature will ultimately be\nmerged; it does mean that the core team has agreed to it in principle and are\namenable to merging it.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is ‘active’\nimplies nothing about what priority is assigned to its implementation, nor\nwhether anybody is currently working on it.</p>\n<p>Modifications to active RFCs can be done in followup PRs. We strive to write\neach RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of the feature; but\nthe nature of the process means that we cannot expect every merged RFC to\nactually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the next major\nrelease; therefore we try to keep each RFC document somewhat in sync with the\nlanguage feature as planned, tracking such changes via followup pull requests\nto the document.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementing-an-rfc\"><a href=\"#implementing-an-rfc\" aria-label=\"implementing an rfc permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Implementing an RFC</h2>\n<p>The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it.
