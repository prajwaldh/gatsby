It was developed with the goal of learning Gatsby. This website is based on the gatsby-contentful-starter and uses Contentful as CMS. It is hosted on Netlify. Hooks are setup with Bitbucket and Contentful to trigger a new build upon code or content changes. The data on Waterscap.es is a mix of original content and informations from the internets gathered and put together.","childScreenshot":{"screenshotFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/ee36f/placeholder.png","srcSet":"/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/91efe/placeholder.png 175w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/d8219/placeholder.png 350w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/ee36f/placeholder.png 700w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/bafb9/placeholder.png 1050w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/1c05c/placeholder.png 1400w,\n/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/0c181/placeholder.png 2048w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/0f0b12b6b0fa7e0b8b6facf4c08d01ba/4c8c4/placeholder.jpg"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/showcase/waterscap.es"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/showcase/waterscap.es"}}
