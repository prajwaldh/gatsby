The number one priority was making a site that was a good reflection of the company and that created a positive user experience.

But Bonnet was also thinking a few years ahead and didn’t want to end up with the same problems that had plagued the Wordpress site, which meant the new site also needed to be simple and easy to maintain. He’s also intrigued by new technologies, and this was when a colleague suggested Gatsby. He investigated both Gatsby and competitors, and for Cyril, the main selling point was that Gatsby was built using a React codebase.
